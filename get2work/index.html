        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The vision or reason for this website is to help others learn and understand the world of web development and programming, which can sometimes be challenging. I aim to find different ways to make it an easier path.<br>
          Even though I'm a beginner in this world, I can offer my visitors the option to have someone who knows what it's like to start from nothing. I'll do my best to learn and put into practice all that I have learned.<br>
